# Auto Studio
A software tool to automatically record and merge camera footage from Canon Camera (using the EDSDK) and audio from another source.

# How to Install
This package only works with python2 for the time being. The easiest way to install is to use pip, then you must get the **EDSDK** and **EdsImage** binaries (x64 if running x64 python) from the canon developer website and drop them into the root of the python package
